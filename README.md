# signlanguagedetection
This project is about sign language detection using Opencv, deeplearning and Python 
1st step starts with creating the datasets training and testing manually using the web cam of the laptop and storing them in the Laptop
2nd step is to create the CNN model and train it using Training datasets created in the previews step and save the model
In 3rd step we use the laod the save model and use predict function to detect the sign language images on the live feed.
